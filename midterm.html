In 1987 his mentor and lover, Peter Hujar, died of AIDS. Later, David learned that he was HIV-positive. After Peter Hujar's death, Wojnarowicz's work moved towards more explicit political content and activist themes, usually centering around social and legal injustice apparent during the AIDS epidemic.</p><br>
<p>Wojnarowicz died in Manhattan home on July 22, 1992 from what was later confirmed as AIDS.</p>
<p>In Spring 2011, the P.P.O.W. gallery showed <i>Spirituality</i>, which was an exhibition of Wojnarowicz's drawings, photographs, videos, and personal notebooks. A retrospective, <i>David Wojnarowicz: History Keeps Me Awake at Night</i>, was announced for exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art in spring 2018. It was co-curated by David Kiehl and David Breslin and received international acclaim.

<p>He was also the author of several book. Each often centered around the political and social issues of the 1980s specifically about the AIDS epidemic. One of his books,<u>Close to the Knives: A Memoir of Disintegration</u>, is an autobiography discussing topics such as his tumultuous childhood, his art career in New York City, and being diagnosed with AIDS. Though his artwork was main way he expressed himself, he used books and other media as a way to speak about the controversies during that time period.</p>
